The implementation of this project involves setting up the ESP32 microcontroller to read data from sensors, process the data, and communicate with a web server for real-time monitoring and alerting. The system uses FreeRTOS tasks for concurrent operations and semaphores for task synchronization. Below, I will explain the implementation in detail while addressing potential expert questions.
System Design and Architecture

Q: How is the system architecture designed? 

The system architecture consists of the ESP32 microcontroller interfacing with an MQ2 gas sensor and a sound sensor. The ESP32 reads data from these sensors, processes the information, and sends it to a web server via WebSockets. The web server displays the data in real-time and triggers alerts when necessary. The ESP32 also controls a buzzer for audible alerts

comment: security alert happend becuz esp32 dtected over 10 HZ sound

Q: Why did you choose FreeRTOS for task management?

FreeRTOS was chosen for its ability to manage multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring efficient and responsive operation. It allows the ESP32 to handle sensor readings, data processing, and communication without blocking other tasks.
Sensor Integration

Q: How are the sensors interfaced with the ESP32?

•	MQ2 Gas Sensor: Connected to GPIO 36 (analog input). It detects gas concentration and provides an analog output.

•	Sound Sensor: Connected to GPIO 34 (analog input). It measures sound intensity and provides an analog output.

•	Buzzer: Connected to GPIO 2 (digital output). It provides audible alerts when triggered.

Q: How do you ensure accurate and reliable sensor readings?

Analog Readings: The ESP32 reads analog values from the sensors using the analogRead function, each sensor is tested independently. 
Data Transmission

Q: How is data transmitted from the ESP32 to the web server? 

Data is transmitted using WebSockets, which provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. This allows real-time data transmission from the ESP32 to the web server. The WebSocket server is initialized on port 81.

comment: esp32 serial port shows that it was connected succefully to the web

Q: What measures are in place to handle data transmission errors or disconnections?
The system includes error handling in the WebSocket event functions. If a disconnection occurs, the ESP32 attempts to reconnect. The web client also has reconnection logic to handle dropped connections.



Security and Alerts

Q: How does the system detect and handle security alerts? 

The system monitors gas levels and sound intensity. If the gas concentration exceeds 50 or the sound level exceeds 10 during the specified security time, the system triggers the buzzer and sends an alert message via WebSockets.

Q: How is the buzzer controlled, and what type of buzzer is used (active or passive)?

The buzzer is controlled using the digitalWrite function for an active buzzer.

Power Management

Q: How does the system manage power consumption? 

The system uses deep sleep mode to conserve power when no alerts are active. The sleeptask manages the transition to and from deep sleep mode using the Watchdog.sleep function. The ESP32 wakes up periodically to check sensor readings and perform necessary tasks.

Q: What are the criteria for entering and exiting deep sleep mode?

The system enters deep sleep mode when no security alerts are active. It wakes up after a specified duration (3 seconds in this case) to check sensor readings and perform tasks.

User Interface

Q: How does the web interface interact with the ESP32? Describe the process of setting security times and receiving alerts.

The web interface communicates with the ESP32 via WebSockets. Users can set security times through the web interface, which sends the time settings to the ESP32. The ESP32 processes these settings and monitors the sensors accordingly. Alerts are sent to the web interface in real-time.

Q: How is the user interface designed to display sensor data and alerts?

The user interface uses charts to display real-time sensor data and modals to show alerts. The data is updated dynamically using WebSocket messages from the ESP32.
Error Handling and Debugging

Q: What error handling mechanisms are implemented in the code?

The code includes error handling for WebSocket events, such as disconnections and invalid data formats. Debugging statements (Serial.println) are used throughout the code to trace execution and identify issues.

Q: How do you debug and troubleshoot issues with the system?

Debugging is done using the Serial Monitor to observe the output of debugging statements. This helps identify where the code might be failing or blocking. Additionally, the web client logs WebSocket events and errors to the browser console for further analysis.
